<summary><strong>1. Experience Description</strong></summary>

<a id="experience-description"></a>

In collaboration with Legendary, Primetime Emmy-Award winning Felix & Paul Studios is expanding the world of Dune into a cinematic-grade, large-scale location-based virtual reality experience.

This project pioneers a bold new way for audiences and fans around the world to enter and explore the Dune universe - deepening their connection to its world and unlocking an entirely new revenue stream for the franchise.

### The How

We will create a large-scale, shared virtual reality experience capable of welcoming up to 170 guests per hour into a fully interactive VR world. This operations is built on the foundation of Felix & Paul Studio's two previous large-scale VR experiences - Space Explorers : The Infinite, and Interstellar Arc.

### The Why

We will transport audiences into the world of Dune as if it was real - and as if audiences were truly living inside it. Audiences will become protagonists in a narrative that unfolds in realtime - like a real-life experience. Only virtual reality can provide this direct and visceral sense of being fully present within, and interacting with, the world of Dune. It's ultimately an opportunity for audiences to deepen their connection to the Dune universe.

<summary><strong>2. North Stars</strong></summary>

<a id="north-stars"></a>

Core principles to keep available in every conversation so epic and intimate moments stay balanced and operationally feasible.

### **Epic + Intimate Poles**
- VR superpowers: present the gigantic at true scale and create striking intimacy. Anchor the experience with deliberate swings between vast, elemental Arrakis spaces and tight, ritual-heavy interiors where eye contact, breath, and silence carry the drama.

### **Who We Are (Group Storytelling)**
- The audience are lead protagonists; identity must work as a group. Pick one coherent in-world role (e.g., a single sietch cell, elite strike cohort, or imperial envoy team) and build every choice, ritual, and mechanic around that shared lens. Locking a clear group identity unblocks tone, mechanics, casting, and keeps agency aligned.

### **Continuous-Time Flow**
- Design as continuous real-time to deepen immersion; avoid hard scene cuts. Only break time diegetically via visions (future/past) to maintain realism while enabling redirection and montage.

### **High-Throughput Interaction**
- Interactive design must support throughput: choices that do not stall onboarding/offboarding; mechanics that keep groups moving while reinforcing immersion (e.g., comms system). Vision transitions are justified by spice density and ritual, preserving flow.

<summary><strong>3. Film Recaps: Part One, Part Two, Messiah</strong></summary>

<a id="recaps"></a>

Consolidated summaries of the essential story events from Denis Villeneuve’s films and the expected *Dune Messiah* adaptation.

<details>
<summary><strong>Part One</strong></summary>

<a id="part-one"></a>

- **Opening state and stakes**: Atreides depart Caladan for Arrakis knowing the Emperor’s “gift” is a trap. Leto plans alliance with Fremen; Jessica’s choice to bear a son makes Paul a volatile Kwisatz Haderach candidate and BG liability.
- **Foreshadowing and tests**:
  - Paul’s dreams of Chani and desert warfare feel probabilistic, not fixed; fear and desire color outcomes.
  - Gom Jabbar: Mohiam’s pain-box test proves Paul’s control; BG timetable wobbles as Jessica and Mohiam argue over destiny ownership.
- **Arrival and sabotage mapping**:
  - Stilgar meeting sets a path to Fremen alliance; Liet-Kynes signals covert sympathy.
  - Thufir/Gurney find Harkonnen tripwires (booby-trapped ‘thopters, sabotaged carryalls), underscoring imperial treachery.
- **Spice overload and ecological awe**:
  - Crawler rescue ends with a worm consuming the harvester; Paul’s first deep spice hit floods senses with branching futures and jihad imagery.
- **Betrayal and fall of Atreides**:
  - Yueh, coerced through his captured wife, drops shields and drugs Leto; Sardaukar join Harkonnens.
  - Leto’s poison-tooth gambit kills Piter, not the Baron; Atreides force collapses.
  - Duncan’s last stand buys Paul/Jessica time; Thufir captured, Gurney goes to ground; Kynes dies alone hallucinating terraforming plans.
- **Desert escape and survival**:
  - Paul/Jessica crash in a thopter, use Voice to escape hunters, and narrowly avoid a worm; Paul tastes spice in stillsuit water, deepening Arrakis bond.
- **Fremen threshold and law**:
  - Stilgar’s troop captures them; Jessica proves value by disarming Stilgar, shifting from execution to negotiation.
  - Jamis invokes tahaddi challenge; Paul kills him—his first lethal duel—earning tribe entry and Jamis’ water.
- **Integration and identity**:
  - Paul named Usul (sietch) and Muad’Dib (public); Jessica becomes Sayyadina-in-training; Chani as guide and early partner recognizes him from her own dreams.
- **Vision weight and resolve**:
  - In the sietch, spice exhaustion deepens prescience: legions chanting Muad’Dib, holy war spreading. Paul commits to survival while fearing the cost of leadership.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Part Two</strong></summary>

<a id="part-two"></a>

- **Opening state and guerrilla war**: Months later, Paul leads Fedaykin raids on Harkonnen spice ops; myths of Lisan al-Gaib swell; Guild/Emperor feel the spice revenue bleed. [Early Formation of the Jihad](#interstitial-2)
- **Sietch politics and faith management**:
  - Paul/Stilgar court southern naibs balancing zeal and pragmatism; Stilgar’s belief in Paul shifts from tactical leader to messiah.
  - Fremen numbers grow; orthodox cells test loyalty and doctrine. [First Rebellions Against Paul](#interstitial-4)
- **Jessica’s ascension and Alia’s awakening**:
  - Jessica survives the Water of Life, becomes Reverend Mother; Alia awakens preborn in the womb with ancestral voices. [First Water of Life Ceremonies](#interstitial-6)
  - Jessica steers prophecy to lock Paul’s legitimacy and stabilize the tribes.
- **Paul’s prescient leap**:
  - Paul drinks the Water of Life seeking clarity; dies/returns, seeing time as a lattice with jihad branches he cannot close. [First Water of Life Ceremonies](#interstitial-6)
  - Prescient knowledge heightens alienation; tactical edge grows.
- **Training and myth-making**:
  - Paul drills shieldless, rhythm-based combat, thumpers, and worm-riding; Fedaykin become shock troops.
  - Public worm ride unifies sietches; religion and tactics fuse.
- **Harkonnen/Imperial counterplay**:
  - On Giedi Prime, Feyd’s arena bout shows him as charismatic, lethal heir; Rabban’s brutality fuels rebellion.
  - Emperor and Guild fret over spice collapse; BG angle through Irulan. [Early Imperial Politics](#interstitial-5)
- **Chani vs. Irulan axis**:
  - Paul and Chani deepen partnership; Irulan is positioned as political consort, creating emotional fracture and succession tension.
- **Imperial landing and siege**:
  - Shaddam arrives with Sardaukar, Guild entourage, and Irulan to crush the revolt; underestimates desert mobility and worm threat. [Early Imperial Politics](#interstitial-5)
- **Shield Wall breach and Battle of Arrakeen**:
  - Paul detonates pre-spice mass (atomics) to open the wall—a Great Convention edge case; worms flood Sardaukar ranks. [Immediate Aftermath of Paul’s Victory](#interstitial-1)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Messiah</strong></summary>

<a id="messiah-film"></a>

- **Opening state and tension**: Twelve years post-jihad; Atreides/Fremen hegemony across the Imperium; Qizarate enforces Muad’Dib faith; CHOAM skewed by spice control; Paul is emperor and messiah but hollowed by violence and prescience-as-prison. [Early Formation of the Jihad](#interstitial-2)
- **Conspiracy architecture and stakes**:
  - Scytale (Tleilaxu Face Dancer) aligns Guild, Bene Gesserit (Mohiam/Irulan), Tleilaxu Masters, and Corrino remnants.
  - Strategy: psychological destabilization over open war—erode Paul’s certainty, isolate him, and remove him without martyring him.
- **Hayt arrives**: Duncan Idaho ghola gifted to Paul, engineered with kill triggers; weaponizes Paul’s grief while tempting Alia’s curiosity about ghola paradoxes.
- **Inciting shocks**:
  - Stone burner in Arrakeen blinds Paul physically; he navigates via prescience, deepening alienation and myth. [First Rebellions Against Paul](#interstitial-4)
  - Qizarate zealots (Korba) and crowds press for harsher theocracy; unrest grows inside the faith-state.
- **Middle pressure**:
  - Paul vs. vision trap: sees only painful branches; contemplates spice-destruction as deterrent. [Early Imperial Politics](#interstitial-5)
  - Chani vs. Irulan: Irulan’s contraceptive sabotage under BG orders; Paul rejects Irulan, shifts Chani to Fremen diet, accelerating a risky pregnancy. [First Water of Life Ceremonies](#interstitial-6)
  - Guild/CHOAM leverage: threaten spacefold slowdown and economic squeeze; Paul’s counter-bluff is annihilating spice.
  - Fremen fracture: Korba accuses Paul of betraying old ways; southern naibs debate faith vs. empire.
  - Alia’s burden: preborn regent-in-training; ancestral voices tempt (Baron Harkonnen) toward cruelty.
- **Conspiracy spring**:
  - Scytale probes Hayt’s conditioning; dangles resurrection bargains; assassin vectors multiply inside the Keep.
  - Paul faces formal charges of impiety; must prove leadership under Fremen custom despite blindness.
- **Crisis and loss**:
  - Chani’s pregnancy peaks; twins Leto II and Ghanima are born; Chani dies—Paul’s foretold pain arrives.
  - Hayt trigger: ordered to kill Paul; awakened Duncan memories override conditioning through loyalty and love. [First Water of Life Ceremonies](#interstitial-6)
  - Public perception wavers: miracle birth vs. omen; Qizarate spins martyrdom; Landsraad senses weakness.
- **Choice and abdication**:
  - Fremen custom: the blind walk into the desert. Paul accepts exile over becoming a puppet or tyrant.
  - Settlement: Irulan remains consort; Alia named regent for the twins; Stilgar stabilizes; Guild/CHOAM placated by continuity. [Deep Desert Pilgrimage](#interstitial-7)
- **Aftermath and seeds**:
  - Paul steps into the dunes, becoming living myth (“the Preacher” whispers begin).
  - Alia holds power but is vulnerable to possession; risk of future tyranny.
  - Twins as Golden Path seed: preternatural awareness; prescient hope to break humanity’s dependence on narrow futures. [Birth of the Fremen Empire](#interstitial-8)

<summary><strong>4. Mechanics & Story Devices</strong></summary>

<a id="devices"></a>


### **Foreshadowing Visions (Echo → Variance)**
- Use visions early to preview future beats (worm-hook catch, Reverend Mother’s guidance, Arrakeen fuse). Mirror key elements later but alter lighting, stakes, or who is present to keep prophecy unstable and agency alive.
- Visions hint at required actions (raise hooks, hold breath, sync steps) without scripting outcomes; players prepare yet must adapt.
- Transitional use: visions justify spatial redirection and temporal montage while preserving diegetic continuous time.

<summary><strong>5. Narrative Opportunities Between Part Two & Messiah</strong></summary>

<a id="interstitial"></a>

Curated “experience nodes” between Villeneuve’s *Part Two* and *Messiah*, aligned to epic scale vs. deep intimacy, continuous flow, group identity, diegetic visions, and high-throughput interactivity. Villeneuve ends *Part Two* with Paul seizing the throne, Fremen fanatic devotion, Chani leaving, and a galaxy on the brink of holy war. *Messiah* begins 12 years later after a jihad reshapes the galaxy—leaving a goldmine in the first days, weeks, and months after ascension.

<a id="interstitial-1"></a>

### **1. Immediate Aftermath of Paul’s Victory**
- **Worldstate**: Feyd is dead, the Emperor is deposed, Fremen ecstatic and volatile.
- **Epic**: Smoldering imperial keep; massive Fremen host chanting “Muad’Dib!”; sandworms circling the plateau at night like living mountains.
- **Intimate**: Reverend Mother (Jessica or new) pulls each guest aside for a post-battle “soul reading”: “Do you know the danger of what we have unleashed?”
- **Group identity**: Fremen guerillas who fought with Paul or Atreides soldiers folded into Fremen ranks.
- **Why it works**: Chaotic, politically fragile, perfect for continuous real-time right after the climax.

<a id="interstitial-3"></a>

### **2. Search for Paul and Jessica**
- **Worldstate**: Shortly after conquest, Paul vanishes into deep desert with elite Fedaykin; Jessica disappears into the south for power consolidation/Water of Life/prescient conditioning.
- **Group story**: You are a Fremen strike cell (or Atreides survivors integrated into Fremen) sent to track Paul’s path, check for hunters, and stop assassination attempts.
- **Epic**: Following worm furrows at night; cresting a dune to reveal a sleeping behemoth; nearly swallowed as it stirs.
- **Intimate**: Tiny incense-smoked sietch shrine visions—possible futures of Paul, risk of a messianic empire, war to come, your role in stabilizing or destabilizing it.

<a id="interstitial-5"></a>

### **3. Early Imperial Politics**
- **Worldstate**: Landsraad in chaos; Guild Navigators fight for spice quotas; Bene Gesserit emissaries angle for control; Sardaukar remnants attempt guerrilla retaliation.
- **Epic**: Colossal Guild Heighliner hovering over Arrakeen; Fremen sandcrawlers like ants under a celestial hull.
- **Intimate**: BG envoy corners your group—probing intentions, testing loyalty, offering forbidden knowledge through whispered Voice. Ideal spot for a Reverend Mother + Gom Jabbar beat.

<a id="interstitial-6"></a>

### **4. First Water of Life Ceremonies**
- **Worldstate**: Jessica oversees dangerous, hallucinatory rites—prescience-adjacent, deeply intimate, visually spectacular.
- **Epic**: Massive underground cavern filled with chanting Fremen; swelling soundscape of voices merging with desert winds; visions of sandworms becoming “gods of time.”
- **Intimate**: Reverend Mother takes each guest’s hand into shared prescient space; direct eye contact names fear, potential, role. Perfect diegetic trigger for flashforwards/branching while keeping continuous time.

<a id="interstitial-7"></a>

### **5. Deep Desert Pilgrimage**
- **Worldstate**: Paul undertakes deep-desert excursions with select Fedaykin.
- **Epic**: Colossal sandstorm; navigation by Arrakis’ moons; surrounded by four or five worms at once.
- **Intimate**: Quiet, lamplit sietch moment; Reverend Mother confides, “Even Muad’Dib fears what he sees.” Personal vision of averting or amplifying catastrophe—individual arcs without breaking group cohesion.

<a id="interstitial-4"></a>

### **6. First Rebellions Against Paul**
- **Worldstate**: Some sietches reject him politically, religiously, culturally—before the jihad goes galactic.
- **Epic**: Approaching a cave-riddled ridge; echoes of rebellious Fremen chants; standoff between Paul-loyalists and a hardline sietch.
- **Intimate**: In the depths, a Reverend Mother tests: “With the child of prophecy or the old ways?” Perfect for Gom Jabbar or vision corridor.
- **Value**: Moral tension felt in VR—social choice, ritual test, reverence vs. danger.

<a id="interstitial-2"></a>

### **7. Early Formation of the Jihad**
- **Worldstate**: Militias and offworld fanatics self-organize; Paul never wanted the jihad, but it builds anyway.
- **Epic**: Massive gathering at the Arrakeen flats; early militias rally; sandworms approach; captured Sardaukar are paraded.
- **Intimate**: Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother warns of the tidal wave; private test (Gom Jabbar variant) to see if you will prevent, survive, or be consumed by it.
- **Flow**: Smoke clearing → chanting crowds → private chamber → visions → back to the desert.

<a id="interstitial-8"></a>

### **8. Birth of the Fremen Empire (First Edicts)**
- **Worldstate**: Early decrees abolish select imperial taxes, restructure CHOAM influence, elevate Fremen as warrior elite, and manage spice flow to check the Guild.
- **Epic**: Balcony view of a city illuminated in Fremen blue, celebrating new power.
- **Intimate**: Jessica (or another Reverend Mother) aside: “History turns on fragile hinges. Even now, you may shape it.”

<summary><strong>6. Character Groups Who Can Have Visions</strong></summary>

<a id="groups"></a>

Below is a clean, production-grade taxonomy of who the audience could be — meaning what in-world identity gives them the right, ability, or need to receive visions — fully aligned with the era between Villeneuve’s *Part Two* and the events of *Dune Messiah*. Grouped by tone, mysticism level, and how naturally they justify visions as a mechanic for spatial redirection and temporal montage.

### **1. Fremen Acolytes Trained by a Reverend Mother**
- Tone: authentic, spiritual, grounded.
- Vision justification: Bene Gesserit dreamshare/trance; diluted Water of Life; shared glimpses guided by the Reverend Mother.
- Why it works for VR: clear cohort identity; visions double as formal training; seamless “towering sandworm → intimate chamber” shifts.
- Era fit: immediately post-*Part Two* as Jessica consolidates Fremen belief.

### **2. Fedaykin Initiates (Paul’s Elite Desert Commandos)**
- Tone: gritty, martial, mythic.
- Vision justification: trance-conditioning; Paul’s tactical battlefield visions; deep-desert spice saturation.
- Why it works: built-in group storytelling; “tactical” visions contrast with religious tones; training scars/caves justify physical space.
- Era fit: Fedaykin rapidly expand after *Part Two*, bridging into early jihad formation.

### **3. Atreides Survivors Being Trained Into Fremen Ways**
- Tone: transitional, emotional, fish-out-of-water.
- Vision justification: controlled spice doses; Reverend Mother loyalty evaluation; tests to “walk the sand” and survive worm proximity.
- Why it works: visions as tests, not gifts; integrates sandworm encounters and sietch rituals; high empathy for outsiders becoming Fremen.
- Era fit: right after *Part Two*, offworlders are absorbed into Fremen culture.

### **4. The Sietch’s Chosen “Dreamwalkers” (Fremen Mystics)**
- Tone: high mysticism, surreal, poetic.
- Vision justification: spice-smoke inhalation, trance chants, group prescience; Jessica or another Reverend Mother as anchor.
- Why it works: maximal abstract imagery; stylized prescience “rooms”; ideal for VR transitions.
- Era fit: mystics matter during Paul’s early consolidation of power.

### **5. Bene Gesserit Operatives Embedded Among the Fremen**
- Tone: political, conspiratorial, psychologically intimate.
- Vision justification: controlled memory/vision recall; Reverend Mother-triggered shared trances; strategic visions to gauge Muad’Dib’s threat.
- Why it works: natural face-to-face Reverend Mother scenes; internal conflict and secret agendas; deep book precedent.
- Era fit: immediately after Paul’s rise, BG tries to reassert influence.

### **6. A Guild-Sanctioned Spice Exposure Team Studying Fremen Tactics**
- Tone: high sci-fi, slightly alien, epistemic.
- Vision justification: low-level prescience training; raw spice or sandworm ichor exposure triggers unstable visions; positioned as observers of how Paul “sees.”
- Why it works: contrast of imperial tech vs. desert mysticism; visions framed as malfunctions/forbidden insights; tension of “seeing what humans shouldn’t.”
- Era fit: post-*Part Two*, the Guild panics over Paul’s spice control and would send undercover teams.

### **7. Tleilaxu Test Subjects in Psychological Conditioning Trials**
- Tone: strange, unsettling, bio-tech mysticism.
- Vision justification: proto-ghola and sensory conditioning; artificial vision induction to test prescience thresholds; early Duncan Idaho ghola ties.
- Why it works: visions explicitly part of Tleilaxu experimentation; freedom for abstract, stylized imagery; continuous “lab → desert → lab” justified.
- Era fit: Tleilaxu are active in *Messiah* and plausibly begin plotting right after *Part Two*.

### **8. Sietch Orphans or Young Fremen Being Tested for Abilities**
- Tone: emotional, intimate, mythic.
- Vision justification: tests for fear, discipline, prescient sensitivity, and spiritual alignment; Jessica’s Reverend Mother role includes testing the next generation.
- Why it works: strong audience identification; shared trial = shared identity; visions feel like childhood prophecy moments.
- Era fit: consistent with early post-*Part Two* sietch politics.

### **Bonus: People to Whom Paul Has Delivered a Vision**
- Tone: mystical, destiny-laden.
- Vision justification: Paul can push prescient flashes to chosen few—an excuse for real-time “edits” of space.
- Era fit: early post-*Part Two*, before Paul retreats inward; works well if climax involves meeting him.

### **Top 3 Vision-Justified Options for VR**
1) Fremen Acolytes / Atreides Survivors undergoing trials (epic worm → intimate test).
2) Fedaykin Initiates conditioned by Paul’s inner circle (tactical premonition for action/traversal).
3) A Bene Gesserit-linked group receiving controlled rituals (cerebral tone; Gom Jabbar-style encounters).

<summary><strong>7. Rules of Visions in Dune</strong></summary>

<a id="vision-rules"></a>

A canonical framework for narrative, design, and VR staging.

### **1. Visions Are Probability Maps, Not Prophecies**
- A vision is a high-resolution prediction, not a guarantee; futures branch and shift as choices change.
- Different prescient people see different branching structures; greater prescience distorts the futures being observed.
- Creative implication: visions can be poetic, broken, or contradictory and remain lore-accurate.

### **2. Spice Is the Universal Accelerator of Visions**
- Triggered by inhaling, ingesting, ambient exposure, or proximity to high-spice zones.
- Mild exposure: sensory distortion and intuition; heavy: symbolic visions and emotional futures; extreme: multi-timeline prescience.
- Creative implication: environmental spice density justifies vision transitions for any character group.

### **3. The Bene Gesserit Can Induce and Control Visions**
- Reverend Mothers guide trances, steer which memories or futures are touched, stabilize otherwise overwhelming visions, and can create shared visions.
- Creative implication: a Reverend Mother is the strongest diegetic tool for vision-triggering and spatial redirection.

### **4. Preborn, Kwisatz Haderach, and Gholas Have Special Vision Properties**
- Preborn perceive ancestral memories, see past and future interwoven, and are vulnerable to prescience overload.
- The Kwisatz Haderach (Paul) sees multiple timelines at once, can push visions toward others, and distorts nearby vision fields.
- Gholas (e.g., Duncan Idaho/Hayt) can flash prior lives; visions arrive as psychological ruptures.
- Creative implication: proximity to these beings can justify involuntary or shared visions.

### **5. Visions Can Be Symbolic, Not Literal**
- They are metaphorical, archetypal, filtered by fear and desire, and may show meaning rather than event geometry.
- Creative implication: abstract VR sequences are not only acceptable but expected.

### **6. Visions Can Be False — Depending on the Observer**
- Sources: spice hallucinations, Bene Gesserit conditioning, implanted suggestions, emotional projections, or dreams misread as omens.
- Creative implication: mixing true futures and psychological illusions stays within canon.

### **7. Prescient Visions Are Shaped by the Visionary’s Intent**
- Prescience bends around the viewer’s fear, desire, and role—Herbert’s “vision trap.”
- Wanting a future reinforces that path; fearing a future can strengthen it.
- Creative implication: visions can foreshadow the group’s emotional arc—fear made manifest.

### **8. Shared Visions Are Canonically Possible**
- Water of Life ceremonies or a Reverend Mother can create collective trances, shared futures, and a single “circle of perception.”
- Creative implication: perfect justification for synchronized group-wide visuals in VR.

### **9. The Water of Life Unlocks Deep Prescience**
- Temporarily narrows the doorway of time, lets initiates touch branching futures directly, alters space/motion perception, and is dangerous.
- Creative implication: diluted or symbolic versions can power major vision beats without full ritual peril.

### **10. Encountering a Sandworm Can Trigger Visions**
- Sandworms generate spice and the prescient ecosystem; proximity boosts ambient spice, disorients, and can trigger visions.
- Creative implication: a giant worm beat can naturally precede a vision transition.

### **11. Visions Precede Transformation or Testing**
- Usually arrive before rites of passage, Gom Jabbar-style tests, identity shifts, political turns, or psychological metamorphosis.
- Creative implication: structure segments as Epic → Vision → Intimate Test → Reorientation → Next Challenge.

### **12. Visions Can Skip Time Without Breaking Continuous Real-Time**
- Time outside the vision flows normally; inside, hours or years can be perceived without physical travel.
- Creative implication: ideal for redirecting the audience physically while maintaining diegetic flow.

### **The Golden Rule of Visions in Dune**
- Prescience is perception of possibility, not destiny; fleeing a vision fulfills it, embracing it makes it slip away. This tension drives Dune’s spiritual engine.
